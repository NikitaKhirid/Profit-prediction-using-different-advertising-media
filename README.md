Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variables.

Aim:
The objective of this project is to built model for different advertising variable known then we have to find how much profit we get.Dataset consists of several Advertising Variables(Independent) and one Outcome Variable(Dependent)The independent variables in this data set are :-'Print Media Expenses','Social Media Expenses','Outdoor Ad Expenses','City'.The outcome variable value is 'Profit'.

We do Exploratory Data Analysis,Data Visualization(Count Plot,Histograms,Box Plot ,Scatter plot,etc),Handle the outliers,Split the data,Encoding the categorical columns and finally built the model.

Conclusion:
The model returns R_Square value of 97.19 % , so it fit our data test very well.
The above score tells that our model is 96.03 % accurate with the training dataset and 97.09% accurate with the test dataset.
